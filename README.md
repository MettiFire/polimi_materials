# Polimi Materials 📚

This repository contains study notes, summaries, slides, and exam-related material from the **Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering** at Politecnico di Milano.  

Most of the content comes from my third year, but you can also find useful material from first- and second-year courses.  

⚠️ Disclaimer: 
- These resources are shared only for educational purposes, to help you study. 
- Not all the material is my own work: you may find some **slides** and **exam texts** from Polimi.  
- I apologize in advance if you occasionally stumble upon doodles or funny comments in my notes ahaha 😅  

📌 Most of the content is in **Italian** 🇮🇹, since the courses were mainly taught in Italian.
